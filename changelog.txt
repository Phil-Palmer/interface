CHANGELOG
02/08/2020

Most notable improvements are the new entity priority system with a static mode.  This increases the game loop
update rate markedly and yields a huge increase in performance in complicated worlds.  We've also clamped down
on entity edit permissions, so users cannot edit unlocked entities unless they have rez permissions on the world.

1. New feature: Added Entity Priority with static mode for dramatically increased game loop update rate
2. Improvement: Simulation activates at closer distance
3. New (old) feature: Grab scale with hands reactivated, with new min/max cap
4. Security: Can only send entityEdit updates if you have rez permissions on a domain
5. Improvement: Adjusted click-time threshold for more responsive edit tools
6. New (old) feature: Reverted to right-joystick flight (needs testing on Vive)
7. Crash bug: Fixed null pointer reference in ETR
8. Crash bug: Fixed audio output device change crash
9. Removed functions getEntityTags and setEntityTags (use edit entity properties instead)
11. Added tooltips for zone culling and priority rendering
12. DRYed up priority sorting and cleaned up code
13. New feature:  Added game loop rate and bypass priority sort to stats
14. Removed "Error downloading asset - You do not have permission to upload to asset server" error messages.
15. Improvement: Updates to the zone culling system so that it plays well with static entities.
